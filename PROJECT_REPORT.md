# Railway Board Letters Management System - Technical Documentation

## System Overview

The Railway Board Letters Management System represents a modern approach to handling official railway communications. This system transforms traditional paper-based letter management into a streamlined digital workflow, enabling real-time tracking, secure access control, and efficient document management across different organizational roles.

## High Level Design (HLD)

### System Architecture Overview

The system follows a modern three-tier architecture, with each layer serving specific functions while maintaining loose coupling for better maintainability and scalability.

#### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React, providing a seamless user experience without page refreshes. This architecture choice enables:

1. Dynamic Content Loading
   The application loads initial shell instantly and dynamically fetches content as needed, resulting in faster perceived performance and better user experience. Each dashboard (GM, SSM, User) loads independently, ensuring that users only download the components relevant to their role.

2. State Management
   Application state is managed centrally using Redux, maintaining consistency across all components. This includes:
   - User authentication state
   - Current letter selections
   - Filter preferences
   - Notification states
   - UI preferences

3. Real-time Updates
   The frontend maintains a WebSocket connection to receive instant updates about:
   - New letter arrivals
   - Status changes
   - User actions
   - System notifications

#### Backend Architecture

The backend is built on Node.js with Express.js, providing a robust and scalable server infrastructure.

1. API Layer
   The REST API is organized around resources:
   - /auth: Handles authentication and authorization
   - /letters: Manages letter operations
   - /users: Handles user management
   - /reports: Generates system reports

2. Middleware Structure
   The backend employs a chain of middleware for:
   - Request validation
   - Authentication verification
   - Role-based access control
   - Error handling
   - Request logging

3. WebSocket Server
   A dedicated WebSocket server handles real-time communications:
   - Maintains connection pools
   - Manages room subscriptions
   - Broadcasts updates
   - Handles reconnection logic

## Authentication and Security

### Authentication Flow

1. Initial Authentication
   When a user attempts to log in:
   ```
   1. Client sends credentials (username/password)
   2. Server validates credentials against hashed passwords
   3. On success, generates JWT with:
      - User ID
      - Role (GM/SSM/User)
      - Department
      - Access level
      - Token expiration
   4. Returns JWT to client
   ```

2. Session Management
   ```
   - JWT stored in secure HTTP-only cookies
   - Client includes JWT in Authorization header
   - Server validates token on each request
   - Automatic token refresh mechanism
   - Session timeout handling
   ```

3. Role-Based Security
   ```
   - GM: Full system access
   - SSM: Department-level access
   - User: Limited, assigned access
   ```

## Component Architecture

### Component Independence

The system is built using independent, reusable components that communicate through well-defined interfaces.

1. Dashboard Components
   ```
   Each dashboard (GM/SSM/User) operates independently:
   - Separate routing
   - Individual state management
   - Role-specific API endpoints
   - Isolated error boundaries
   ```

2. Letter Management Components
   ```
   Letter handling components are modular:
   - Creation interface
   - Viewing interface
   - Search component
   - Filter component
   Each can be used independently or combined
   ```

3. User Management Components
   ```
   User management split into:
   - User creation
   - Role assignment
   - Department management
   - Password management
   ```

### Component Communication

Components communicate through multiple channels:

1. Direct Props
   ```
   - Parent-child communication
   - Callback functions
   - Data passing
   ```

2. Global State
   ```
   - Authentication state
   - User preferences
   - System settings
   ```

3. Event Bus
   ```
   - Cross-component notifications
   - System-wide updates
   - Error broadcasting
   ```

## Database Design and Data Flow

### Database Architecture

The system uses MongoDB for its flexibility and scalability in handling document-based data.

1. Users Collection Schema
   ```json
   {
     "_id": "ObjectId",
     "username": "String (unique)",
     "password": "Hashed String",
     "role": "Enum['GM', 'SSM', 'USER']",
     "department": "String",
     "accessLevel": "Number",
     "status": "Enum['active', 'inactive']",
     "lastLogin": "Date",
     "createdAt": "Date",
     "updatedAt": "Date"
   }
   ```

2. Letters Collection Schema
   ```json
   {
     "_id": "ObjectId",
     "referenceNumber": "String (unique)",
     "subject": "String",
     "content": "String",
     "createdBy": "ObjectId (ref: Users)",
     "createdDate": "Date",
     "status": "Enum['draft', 'active', 'closed']",
     "attachments": [{
       "filename": "String",
       "path": "String",
       "uploadDate": "Date"
     }],
     "visibilityList": ["ObjectId (ref: Users)"],
     "metadata": {
       "priority": "String",
       "category": "String",
       "tags": ["String"]
     }
   }
   ```

### Data Flow Patterns

1. Letter Creation Flow
   ```
   SSM -> Create Letter
     -> Generate Reference
     -> Save to Database
     -> Notify Recipients
     -> Update Dashboard
     -> Archive Original
   ```

2. Access Control Flow
   ```
   Request -> JWT Validation
          -> Role Check
          -> Department Check
          -> Access Grant/Deny
          -> Action Logging
   ```

3. Report Generation Flow
   ```
   Request -> Data Aggregation
          -> Filter Application
          -> Calculation
          -> Format Output
          -> Generate Document
   ```
