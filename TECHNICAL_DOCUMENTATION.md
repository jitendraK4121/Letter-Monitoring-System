# Railway Board Letters Management System - Technical Documentation

## 1. Introduction

The Railway Board Letters Management System is a comprehensive digital solution designed to modernize and streamline the handling of official communications within the railway organization. This document provides a detailed technical overview of the system's architecture, components, and functionality.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Three-Tier Architecture Overview

The system implements a modern three-tier architecture that separates concerns while maintaining high cohesion and loose coupling:

Frontend Tier (Presentation Layer):
A React-based Single Page Application handles the user interface. This layer is responsible for:
- Rendering role-specific dashboards (GM, SSM, User interfaces)
- Managing client-side state and caching
- Handling user interactions and input validation
- Real-time updates through WebSocket connections
- File upload/download management

Application Tier (Business Logic Layer):
Built on Node.js and Express.js, this layer:
- Processes all business logic
- Handles authentication and authorization
- Manages session states
- Coordinates data flow between frontend and database
- Implements real-time communication through WebSocket
- Processes file uploads and generates reports

Data Tier (Persistence Layer):
MongoDB serves as the primary database, chosen for its:
- Document-oriented structure matching letter format
- Flexible schema for evolving requirements
- Efficient querying capabilities
- GridFS support for file storage
- Robust indexing options

### 2.2 Authentication System

The authentication system uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with a sophisticated security model:

Token Generation Process:
1. User submits credentials
2. Server validates against hashed password
3. Creates JWT containing:
   - User identifier
   - Role information
   - Department code
   - Access level
   - Expiration timestamp
4. Token is signed with server's private key
5. Returned to client for subsequent requests

Session Management:
- Tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
- Regular token rotation for security
- Automatic session extension on activity
- Forced re-authentication for sensitive operations

Role-Based Access Control:
General Manager (GM):
- Full system access
- User management capabilities
- System-wide reporting access
- Configuration management rights

Senior Section Manager (SSM):
- Department-specific access
- Letter creation and management
- Team member management
- Limited reporting capabilities

Regular Users:
- View assigned letters
- Basic search functionality
- Personal profile management

## 3. Component Architecture

### 3.1 Frontend Components

Dashboard System:
Each role has a specialized dashboard built from reusable components:

GM Dashboard:
- System overview component
- User management interface
- Report generation module
- Configuration panel
- Global search component

SSM Dashboard:
- Letter creation wizard
- Team management panel
- Department overview
- Document tracking interface

User Dashboard:
- Letter viewer
- Search interface
- Profile management

### 3.2 Component Communication

Inter-component communication happens through multiple channels:

State Management:
- Redux store for global state
- Local component state for UI elements
- Context API for theme and preferences

Event System:
- Custom event bus for cross-component communication
- WebSocket events for real-time updates
- Browser events for system notifications

## 4. Database Design

### 4.1 Collections Structure

Users Collection:
{
    _id: ObjectId,
    username: String,
    passwordHash: String,
    role: String,
    department: String,
    accessLevel: Number,
    status: String,
    lastLogin: Date,
    createdAt: Date,
    updatedAt: Date
}

Letters Collection:
{
    _id: ObjectId,
    referenceNumber: String,
    subject: String,
    content: String,
    createdBy: ObjectId,
    createdDate: Date,
    status: String,
    attachments: Array,
    visibilityList: Array,
    metadata: Object
}

### 4.2 Data Relationships

The system maintains relationships through:
- Reference IDs between collections
- Visibility lists for access control
- Department-based grouping
- Role-based permissions

## 5. Real-Time Features

### 5.1 WebSocket Implementation

The system maintains real-time updates through WebSocket connections:

Connection Management:
- Automatic connection establishment
- Heartbeat monitoring
- Reconnection handling
- Session persistence

Event Types:
- Letter creation notifications
- Status updates
- User action broadcasts
- System announcements

### 5.2 Update Propagation

Updates flow through the system:
1. Database change occurs
2. Server detects change
3. WebSocket server notified
4. Relevant clients updated
5. UI refreshed automatically

## 6. Security Implementation

### 6.1 Access Control

Hierarchical Permission System:
- Role-based access control
- Department-level permissions
- Document-level access control
- Temporary access grants

Security Measures:
- Input sanitization
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting
- Request validation

### 6.2 Password Management

Password Change Implementation:
- Separate endpoints for self-service and administrative password changes
- Current password verification for self-service changes
- Password confirmation to prevent typos
- Client-side validation for password requirements
- Server-side validation for security

Password Change Flow:
1. User initiates password change from dashboard
2. Client validates:
   - New password meets requirements
   - Confirmation password matches
   - Current password provided
3. Server validates:
   - User authentication
   - Current password correctness
   - Password complexity requirements
4. On success:
   - Password is hashed and updated
   - Session is maintained
   - Success confirmation displayed

API Endpoints:
```
POST /api/auth/change-password
- Requires: current password, new password
- Returns: success/error message
- Protected by: JWT authentication

POST /api/auth/change-user-password (Admin only)
- Requires: user ID, new password
- Returns: success/error message
- Protected by: JWT authentication, role verification

### 6.2 Data Protection

Multiple layers of data security:
- Encrypted storage
- Secure transmission
- Access logging
- Audit trails
- Backup systems
